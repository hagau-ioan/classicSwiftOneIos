* Apple provides development snapshots of the Swift compiler that include the latest features,  including the swift-testing library.  This approach is considered experimental and may not be suitable for production use.
    Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:
    Download a recent development snapshot toolchain from https://swift.org/download/.
    Follow the instructions for using the downloaded toolchain with your project.
    The swift-testing library should be included by default with the development snapshot toolchain.
    EXPERIMENTAL (01.07.2024)
    Still under development: The swift-testing library is currently considered experimental. This means it's still undergoing active development and may not be feature-complete or fully optimized for production use.
 
 *************** Before using Swift Testing, ensure that you have Xcode 16.0+ and Swift 6.0+**************
